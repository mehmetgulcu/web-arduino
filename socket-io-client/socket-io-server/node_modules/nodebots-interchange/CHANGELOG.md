is supplied using `--firmata=<name>`. No named supply will attempt to install a
default if one exists.

## 0.3.0

* Added ability to list the ports available on the machine + docs

what Interchange thinks is on it use `interchange read -p /device/path`
* Added creator directory

### 0.1.4

* Added capability to load standard firmata directly with `install StandardFirmata`
* updated docs, fixed paths for the manifest file
* Updated hex and manifest download to put a timestamp on end of the request
because github raw has a very long cache.

### 0.1.3

* refactored code to allow for different ways to get the code to download the
files for flashing to the board.

### 0.1.2

* Fixed manifest bug that was present from error checking
* Migrated to new manifest style
